<h2>CPRG303: Mobile Development Lab-Assignment </h2>
<strong> Reiteration of the Assignment: </strong>

This lab assignment consists of three parts aimed at improving your React Native project's code organization and maintainability.

<ul>
  <h3>Part 1: Hard Code ToDo List and Form</h3>
  <li>Open the App.jsx file in the project directory.</li>
  <li>Manually create the ToDo list items and the form to add tasks directly within the App.jsx file.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the code structure closely resembles the provided App.jsx file.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <h3>Part 2: Move Into Separate Files</h3>
  <li>Create a new file named ToDoList.jsx in the project directory.</li>
  <li>Copy the code that contains the task list (likely wrapped in a ScrollView) from the App.jsx file and paste it into ToDoList.jsx.</li>
  <li>Import any necessary components and styles into ToDoList.jsx.</li>
  <li>Create another new file named ToDoForm.jsx in the project directory.</li>
  <li>Copy the code that contains the input field and button from the App.jsx file and paste it into ToDoForm.jsx.</li>
  <li>Import any necessary components and styles into ToDoForm.jsx.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <h3>Part 3: Import Separate Components</h3>
  <li>Go back to the App.jsx file.</li>
  <li>Import the ToDoList and ToDoForm components into the App.jsx file.</li>
  <li>Replace the hard-coded ToDo list and form sections in the App.jsx file with references to the imported ToDoList and ToDoForm components, effectively modularizing the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These instructions guide you through the process of initially hard-coding a ToDo list and form within the App.jsx file and then refactoring and organizing the code into separate ToDoList.jsx and ToDoForm.jsx files. Importing these modular components back into the App.jsx file allows you to create a more structured and maintainable codebase.</p>

<p><strong>Tools used/required:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Android Emulator</li>
  <li>NodeJS LTS</li>
  <li>React Native (ensure it is installed)</li>
</ul>
